### What I learned

In this project, I've grasped the fundamentals of TypeScript with Next 13, delving into server-side and client-side rendering. Despite the project's size, I've glimpsed the potential of these powerful features. Additionally, I've mastered toggling between dark and light modes, and refined my styling skills using flexbox and grid layouts.

### Continued development

Having unearthed the capabilities of Next.js and its remarkable potential for crafting full-stack applications through server-side rendering, I am compelled to persist on this path, creating an array of applications using this framework.
